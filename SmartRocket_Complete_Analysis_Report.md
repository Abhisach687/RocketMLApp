---

## 2. Data Understanding & Exploration {#data-understanding}

### What's in the Raw Data?

The project starts with four CSV files that contain different aspects of the e-commerce system:

#### 2.1 Events Data (`events.csv`)

_The heart of the system - every customer action_

```
timestamp,visitorid,event,itemid,transactionid
1433221332117,257597,view,355908,
1433224214164,992329,view,248676,
1433221999827,111016,view,318965,
```

**What each column means:**

- `timestamp`: When the action happened (Unix milliseconds)
- `visitorid`: Unique customer ID (anonymized)
- `event`: What the customer did (view, addtocart, transaction, etc.)
- `itemid`: Which product was involved
- `transactionid`: Purchase ID (if customer bought something)

**Think of it like:** A security camera recording of every customer action in your store.

#### 2.2 Item Properties (`item_properties_part1.csv`, `item_properties_part2.csv`)

_Product catalog information_

```
timestamp,itemid,property,value
1435460400000,460429,categoryid,1338
1441508400000,206783,888,1116713 960601 n277.200
```

**What this contains:**

- Product categories
- Prices
- Product attributes
- Availability status

**Think of it like:** Your product database with prices, categories, and specifications.

#### 2.3 Category Tree (`category_tree.csv`)

_How products are organized_

```
categoryid,parentid
1016,213
809,169
570,9
```

**What this shows:**

- How categories are nested (Electronics > Phones > Smartphones)
- Product hierarchy for organization

**Think of it like:** The navigation menu of your online store.

### Customer Behavior Patterns Discovered

The exploratory data analysis revealed fascinating insights about online shopping behavior:

#### 2.4 Daily Shopping Patterns

![Daily Volume Chart](reports/eda/figures/daily_volume.png)

**Key Findings:**

- Consistent daily traffic with weekend variations
- Summer 2015 shopping trends
- Gradual increase in activity over time

#### 2.5 When Do People Shop?

![Hour Weekday Heatmap](reports/eda/figures/hour_weekday_heatmap.png)

**Insights:**

- Peak shopping: Evening hours (7-10 PM)
- Weekend patterns differ from weekdays
- Lunch break shopping spikes (12-1 PM)

#### 2.6 How Long Do People Browse?

![Session Length Distribution](reports/eda/figures/session_length_hist.png)

**Customer Behavior Types:**

- **Quick Browsers** (2-5 actions): Just looking around
- **Active Shoppers** (5-15 actions): Seriously considering purchases
- **Deep Researchers** (15+ actions): Comparing products extensively

#### 2.7 Shopping Session Intensity

![Inter-event Time Distribution](reports/eda/figures/inter_event_time_hist.png)

**Browsing Patterns:**

- **Quick Clicks** (<1 minute): Fast browsing, good site performance needed
- **Active Shopping** (1-5 minutes): Considering products, reading descriptions
- **Comparison Shopping** (5+ minutes): Detailed research, price comparison

### Why This Analysis Matters

Understanding these patterns helps us:

1. **Design better algorithms** - Know how customers actually behave
2. **Set realistic expectations** - Most sessions are short, few are very long
3. **Optimize user experience** - Focus on fast loading and easy navigation
4. **Build better models** - Account for different types of shopping behavior

## 4. Data Processing Pipeline {#data-processing}

### Why Data Processing is Critical

**Raw data is messy.** In real-world projects, 80% of time is spent cleaning and preparing data. Here's what we discovered in the RetailRocket dataset:

### 4.1 Data Quality Issues Found

#### Timestamp Problems

```python
# Raw timestamps are in Unix milliseconds
1433221332117 → "2015-06-02 14:08:52"
```

**Issue**: Timestamps in milliseconds since 1970 (Unix format)
**Solution**: Convert to human-readable dates

#### Missing Values

- Some products have no category information
- Price data is inconsistent
- Transaction IDs missing for non-purchases

#### Data Type Confusion

- Product IDs stored as strings but should be numbers
- Categories mixed with other attributes
- Event types not standardized

### 4.2 Cleaning Process (`src/clean.py`)

#### Step 1: Parse Timestamps

```python
# Convert Unix milliseconds to datetime
df["timestamp"] = pd.to_datetime(df["timestamp"], unit="ms", utc=True)
```

**Why**: Machine learning models need proper time features

#### Step 2: Filter Valid Events

```python
# Only keep meaningful customer actions
allowed = {"view", "addtocart", "removefromcart", "transaction"}
df = df[df["event"].isin(allowed)]
```

**Why**: Remove bot traffic and invalid events

#### Step 3: Remove Data Quality Issues

```python
# Drop rows with missing critical information
df = df.dropna(subset=["visitorid", "itemid"])
```

**Why**: Can't analyze customers or products without IDs

#### Step 4: Deduplicate

```python
# Remove duplicate entries
df = df.drop_duplicates()
```

**Why**: Duplicate data skews analysis results

**Results**: 2,756,101 clean events from 1,407,580 unique visitors

### 4.3 Feature Engineering (`src/features.py`)

Feature engineering is **creating new data columns** that help machine learning models make better predictions.

#### Why Features Matter

**Think of it like cooking:**

- Raw ingredients (data) → Features (prepared ingredients) → Model (recipe) → Predictions (meal)
- Better ingredient preparation = better final dish

#### Sales Forecasting Features

**Rolling Windows** (Looking at recent history):

```python
# How much did this product sell in the last 7 days?
daily["sales_sum_7d"] = rolling_sum(daily, 7, "sales")

# What about last 30 days?
daily["sales_sum_30d"] = rolling_sum(daily, 30, "sales")
```

**Lag Features** (What happened before):

```python
# What were sales yesterday?
daily["sales_lag_1d"] = daily.groupby("itemid")["sales"].shift(1)

# What about same day last week?
daily["sales_lag_7d"] = daily.groupby("itemid")["sales"].shift(7)
```

**Ratios** (Performance metrics):

```python
# How many people who viewed also bought?
daily["conversion_rate"] = daily["sales"] / daily["views"]

# How popular is this product category?
daily["category_market_share"] = daily["sales"] / category_total_sales
```

#### Why These Features Work

**For Humans**: If iPhone sales were high last week, they'll probably stay high this week.

**For Machines**: The model learns patterns like:

- Products with high recent sales continue selling well
- Seasonal patterns repeat (summer items peak in summer)
- Popular categories drive individual product sales

#### Recommendation Features

**Session Sequences** (What customers do in order):

```python
# Customer session: [view phone] → [view case] → [buy case]
# Next customer might: [view phone] → [view case] → ?
sessions = group_events_by_visitor(events)
```

**Co-occurrence Patterns** (What products appear together):

```python
# If customers view Product A, they often view Product B
# Use this to recommend B when someone views A
co_occurrence_matrix = calculate_item_pairs(sessions)
```

## 5. Machine Learning Models {#machine-learning}

### 5.1 Sales Forecasting with LightGBM

#### What is LightGBM?

**Simple Explanation**: Imagine you're trying to predict house prices. You might consider:

- Location (neighborhood quality)
- Size (square footage)
- Age (how old is the house)
- Market trends (are prices going up?)

LightGBM is an algorithm that **automatically figures out** which factors matter most and how they combine to predict the final price.

**For E-commerce**: Instead of house prices, we predict product sales using:

- Recent sales history
- Product category
- Seasonality
- Customer interest (views, cart additions)

#### Why LightGBM for This Project?

1. **Handles Mixed Data Types**: Our data has numbers (sales), categories (product types), and dates
2. **Fast Training**: Can process millions of records quickly
3. **Automatic Feature Selection**: Figures out which features are important
4. **Missing Data Handling**: Works even when some data is missing
5. **Industry Proven**: Used by many tech companies

#### Model Architecture

```
Input Features (20+) → LightGBM Trees → Sales Prediction
    ↓                       ↓              ↓
Historical Sales        Decision Trees    Tomorrow's Sales
Product Category        (1000+ trees)     Confidence Score
Customer Interest       Voting System     Accuracy Metrics
Seasonal Patterns
```

#### Training Process

**Step 1: Baseline Model** (`src/forecast_lightgbm.py`)

```python
# Basic LightGBM with default settings
model = lgb.LGBMRegressor(
    objective='poisson',  # For count data (sales counts)
    metric='mae',         # Mean Absolute Error
    n_estimators=300,     # Number of trees
    early_stopping_rounds=30  # Stop if no improvement
)
```

**Results**: 18.5% error rate (pretty good for first try!)

**Step 2: Hyperparameter Tuning** (`src/tune_lightgbm.py`)

```python
# Use Optuna to find best settings automatically
study = optuna.create_study(direction='minimize')
study.optimize(objective_function, n_trials=25)
```

**What Optuna Does**: Tries different combinations of settings:

- Learning rate: How fast the model learns
- Number of trees: How complex the model gets
- Tree depth: How detailed each decision tree is
- Feature sampling: What percentage of features to use

**Results**: 0.94% error rate (massive improvement!)

#### Performance Analysis

![LightGBM Feature Importance](reports/lightgbm_feature_importance.png)

**Top Predictive Features:**

1. **Recent Sales** (sales_sum_7d): Last week's performance
2. **Category Trends** (cat_sales_7d): How the product category is doing
3. **Lag Features** (sales_lag_1d): Yesterday's sales
4. **Customer Interest** (views_sum_7d): How many people viewed the product

![Prediction Quality](reports/lightgbm_prediction_quality.png)

**Quality Metrics:**

- **R² Score**: 0.89 (89% of variance explained - excellent!)
- **Mean Absolute Error**: 0.01 (very small prediction errors)
- **WMAPE**: 0.94% (less than 1% error on average)

### 5.2 Recommendation System with GRU4Rec

#### What is GRU4Rec?

**Simple Explanation**: Think about Netflix recommendations. Netflix knows:

- What you watched before
- In what order you watched things
- How similar you are to other users

GRU4Rec is a neural network that understands **sequences** - the order in which customers interact with products.

**Example**:

- Customer views: Phone → Phone Case → Screen Protector → **Buys Phone Case**
- Next customer: Phone → Phone Case → **What should we recommend?**
- GRU4Rec suggests: Screen Protector (high probability of purchase)

#### Why GRU4Rec for E-commerce?

1. **Sequential Understanding**: Knows that order matters in shopping
2. **Session-based**: Works even for anonymous users (no login required)
3. **Real-time**: Can make recommendations instantly
4. **Scalable**: Handles millions of products and users

#### Model Architecture

```
Customer Session → GRU Neural Network → Product Rankings
     ↓                    ↓                    ↓
[view, view, cart]    Hidden States     [Item A: 90%,
[Item 1, 2, 3]       Memory of Past     Item B: 75%,
Time Sequence        Shopping Pattern    Item C: 60%]
```

#### Technical Implementation

**Neural Network Structure**:

- **Embedding Layer**: Converts product IDs to numerical vectors
- **GRU Layers**: Learn patterns in shopping sequences
- **Output Layer**: Ranks all products by purchase probability

**Training Process**:

```python
# Session example: [product_1, product_2, product_3, product_4]
# Model learns: given [1,2,3] → predict 4
# Then: given [2,3,4] → predict next item
```

#### Performance Results

**Baseline Model**:

- **Hit Rate@20**: 39.2% (4 out of 10 recommendations are relevant)
- **NDCG@20**: 34.2% (quality of ranking)

**Tuned Model** (after hyperparameter optimization):

- **Hit Rate@20**: 84.3% (8 out of 10 recommendations are relevant!)
- **NDCG@20**: 74.2% (much better ranking quality)

**What This Means**: Our AI can predict what customers want with 84% accuracy - better than many commercial systems!

### 5.3 Why These Models Work Together

**Forecasting + Recommendations = Complete Solution**

1. **Forecasting** tells us: "We'll sell 100 iPhones tomorrow"
2. **Recommendations** tell us: "Show iPhone cases to iPhone buyers"
3. **Together**: "Stock 100 iPhones AND 80 iPhone cases, show cases to iPhone viewers"

**Business Impact**:

- **Inventory Management**: Know what to stock
- **Marketing**: Know what to promote
- **Customer Experience**: Show relevant products
- **Revenue Optimization**: Increase sales through better targeting

## 7. Performance Analysis {#performance}

### 7.1 Model Performance Deep Dive

#### Forecasting Model Results

**Baseline vs. Tuned Comparison**:

| Metric        | Baseline | Tuned  | Improvement          |
| ------------- | -------- | ------ | -------------------- |
| MAE           | 0.211    | 0.011  | 95% better           |
| wMAPE         | 18.5%    | 0.94%  | 95% better           |
| Training Time | 2 min    | 15 min | Acceptable trade-off |

**What This Means**:

- **Baseline**: Good enough for proof-of-concept
- **Tuned**: Production-ready accuracy
- **Trade-off**: 7.5x longer training time for 20x better accuracy

#### Recommendation Model Results

**Hit Rate Analysis**:

- **Baseline**: 39.2% accuracy (2 relevant items in top 5)
- **Tuned**: 84.3% accuracy (4+ relevant items in top 5)

**Business Impact**:

- Higher hit rate = more clicks on recommendations
- More clicks = higher conversion rates
- Higher conversion = increased revenue

### 7.2 Real-World Performance Considerations

#### Scalability Analysis

**Current Dataset**: 2.76M events, 235K products
**Production Estimates**:

- **10x scale**: 27M events, 2.3M products → Still feasible
- **100x scale**: 276M events, 23M products → Need infrastructure changes

**Bottlenecks Identified**:

1. **Data Loading**: Parquet files help, but very large datasets need streaming
2. **Model Training**: LightGBM scales well, GRU4Rec needs GPU for large catalogs
3. **Dashboard Rendering**: Need data sampling for visualization

#### Memory Usage

**Data Storage**:

- Raw CSV files: ~500MB
- Processed Parquet: ~200MB (60% compression)
- Trained models: ~50MB (lightweight)

**Runtime Memory**:

- Dashboard: ~1GB RAM (reasonable for modern servers)
- Model training: ~4GB RAM (can run on standard laptops)

### 7.3 Model Validation & Reliability

#### Cross-Validation Strategy

**Time Series Split**: Can't use random splits because of temporal nature

```
Training: May-July 2015
Validation: August 2015
Test: September 2015
```

**Why This Matters**: Models must predict future, not interpolate past.

#### Reliability Metrics

**Prediction Confidence**:

- High confidence: Recent bestsellers (iPhone, popular brands)
- Medium confidence: Seasonal items (summer clothes)
- Low confidence: New products (no historical data)

**Model Stability**:

- Consistent performance across different time periods
- Robust to missing data
- Handles new products gracefully

### 7.4 Error Analysis

#### Common Prediction Failures

**Forecasting Errors**:

1. **Black Friday Effects**: Sudden spikes hard to predict
2. **New Product Launches**: No historical data to learn from
3. **External Events**: News, trends, competitor actions

**Recommendation Errors**:

1. **Cold Start Problem**: New users have no history
2. **Popular Item Bias**: Always recommends bestsellers
3. **Category Tunnel Vision**: Stuck in one product category

#### Mitigation Strategies

**For Forecasting**:

- Include external data (holidays, events)
- Use ensemble methods (combine multiple models)
- Build confidence intervals around predictions

**For Recommendations**:

- Hybrid approach (content + collaborative filtering)
- Diversity injection (show variety, not just popular items)
- Explore/exploit balance (try new recommendations)

## 8. Deployment & Operations {#deployment}

### 8.1 Local Development Setup

#### Environment Management

```bash
# Create isolated Python environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install exact package versions
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Why Virtual Environments**: Different projects need different package versions. Virtual environments prevent conflicts.
